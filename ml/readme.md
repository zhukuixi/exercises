ML Engineer Exercise
=========

Overview
--------

This exercise requires the engineer to perform a range of tasks using the deals.txt file located in the data directory. The deals.txt file should remain unchanged, and any mutations on the data should happen as part of your submission.

Each task has an individual python file in the mywork package directory, please confine your solution for each task within those files. In addition, there is a test directory in the project root, with an associated test_* python file, where your unit tests will go. 

Requirements
------------

Your code should meet the following requirements:

* Be [PEP8] compliant
* Implement a unit test for each material function, capable of being tested using [pytest] or [nosetest]
* Contain sufficient docstrings and comments to make it easy to reason about

Things to keep in mind
----------------------
- Each task is designed to explore a specific domain approach and technical method. Read the header carefully as the problem and the approach to solving it are carefully described therein
- There is definitely not one solution for each task, so if you feel there are multiple, valid approaches, please implement them, we can use these for follow-up discussions
